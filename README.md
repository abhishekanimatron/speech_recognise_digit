# Hidden Markov Model for Digit Recognition

## Overview

This project implements a **Hidden Markov Model (HMM)** to recognize spoken digits. The system is designed to accurately identify digits from 'Zero' to 'Nine' in human speech. With over **90% accuracy**, it provides a robust solution for digit recognition in audio signals.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition:** Accurately identifies spoken digits from 'Zero' to 'Nine'.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves over 90% accuracy in recognizing digits.
- **Speech Processing:** Utilizes HMM to model and decode speech signals for digit recognition.
